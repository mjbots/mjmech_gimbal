   mjmech

 * IMU not starting reliably was a result of using read_us when the
   old code was expecting a 100us clock tick.
 * Verified laser, agitator, AEG and gimbal motors all work properly.
   Had to turn down the kd term some, probably because the IMU is
   mounted closer to the motor.
 * Verified it is running at 800Hz already

DONE 2019-04-27
 * Got I2C and SPI working
 * Got analog sampling working
 * Got BLDC outputs work
